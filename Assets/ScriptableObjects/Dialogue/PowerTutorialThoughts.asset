  - Speaker: Thinking
    Body: Hm... I need to find a way out of this room, maybe I should try opening
      the <color=red>door</color>
  - Speaker: Thinking
    Body: Oh no! the power seems to have gone out. Maybe I need to change the power
      source by <color=red>pulling on the lever</color>.
  - Speaker: Thinking
    Body: The <color=red>Power LED</color> seems to indicate there is still no power.
      I need to find and insert the battery.
  - Speaker: Thinking
    Body: The power seems to have come back on, I can now open the door. The number
      shows the battery level, I must hurry before the battery drains.
