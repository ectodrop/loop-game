  - Speaker: Thinking
    Body: Looks like the breaker is behind this <color=red>door</color>, let's see
      if I can open it without any power.
  - Speaker: Thinking
    Body: Nothing, figures... I think there's an emergency power unit <color=red>with
      a lever</color> somewhere in this room that I can turn on.
  - Speaker: Thinking
    Body: This thing is useless without a <color=red>battery</color>. The battery
      must be somewhere in this room.
  - Speaker: Thinking
    Body: Nice! I think the door switch just regained power, I better hurry though,
      it looks like the battery drains super fast!
  - Speaker: Thinking
    Body: Damn, battery drained before I could make it out. (Press <color=red>ESC</color>
      to restart)
